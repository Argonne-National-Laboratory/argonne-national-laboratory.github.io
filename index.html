        <h3>
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/diatomic/tess">Tess</a></h3>
<p>Computing a Voronoi or Delaunay tessellation from a set of points is a core part of the analysis of many simulated and measured datasets. As the scale of simulations and observations surpasses billions of particles, a distributed-memory scalable parallel algorithm is the only feasible approach. The primary contribution of this software is a distributed-memory parallel Delaunay and Voronoi tessellation algorithm based on existing serial computational geometry libraries that automatically determines which neighbor points need to be exchanged among the subdomains of a spatial decomposition. Other features include periodic and wall boundary conditions.</p>
<h3><a href="https://subversion.xray.aps.anl.gov/">APS Subversion Repositories</a></h3>
<p>Argonne's Advanced Photon Source is a synchrotron light source that produces high-energy, high-brightness x-ray beams. The source is optimized to put large quantities of high-energy photons into a very small area in a very short time.The XRAY subversion server supports the Xray beamlines at the Advanced Photon Source. </p>
<h3><a href="https://github.com/tomopy/tomopy">Tomopy</a></h3>
<p>TomoPy is a Python toolbox to perform tomographic data processing and image reconstruction tasks at the Advanced Photon Source (http://www.aps.anl.gov).</p>
<h3><a href="https://github.com/Argonne-National-Laboratory/GFM">GFM</a></h3>
<p>The GFM glass furnace simulation model that was developed is a tool industry can use to
help define and evaluate furnace design changes and operating strategies to: 1) reduce
energy use per unit of production; 2) solve problems related to production and glass
quality by defining optimal operating windows to reduce cullet generation due to rejects
and maximize throughput; and 3) make changes in furnace design and/or operation to
reduce critical emissions, such as NO x and particulates.</p>
<h3><a href="https://github.com/Argonne-National-Laboratory/PyGMI">PyGMI</a></h3>
<p>PyGMI is an open source Generic Measurements Interface made in Python/Qt that can take measurements with instruments connected over GPIB, RS232, ethernet or USB using Pyvisa and PySerial.</p>
<h3><a href="https://github.com/Argonne-National-Laboratory/ProMC">ProMC</a></h3>
<p>ProMC is a library for file input and output of Monte Carlo event records or any HEP structural data. The main features are:
<ul>
<li>Content-dependent compression. Event records are encoded using Google protocol buffers with variable number of bytes ("varints"). This leads to 30% (and more) smaller file sizes compared to any known compression based on a fixed-length representation of numeric information.
<li>Multiplatform. Data records can be read and can be written natively in C++, Java and Python.
<li>Self-describing data format. Analysis source codes can be generated from ProMC files with unknown data layouts.
<li>Forwards-compatible and backwards-compatible binary wire format.
<li>Random access. Events can be read starting at any index.
<li>Fast. No CPU overhead on decompression of events
<li>Simplicity. No external dependence. The library is small and self-contained. The library has been deployed on BlueGene/Q.
</ul></p>
<h3><a href="https://github.com/Argonne-National-Laboratory/Arcond">Arcond</a></h3>
<p>ArCond (ARgonne CONDor) is a package to facilitate running multiple jobs in parallel using a PC farm with local data storage, i.e. when data scattered over many PCs. The package was designed for a Tier-3 type of clusters consisting of a number of independent computer notes (PCs) with a local file storage on each node (i.e. disks), and a common NFS-mounted user (or share) directories. No any server computer is necessary.</p>
<h3><a href="https://github.com/Argonne-National-Laboratory/jcondor">Jcondor</a></h3>
<p>jCondor was used as a GUI for monitoring clusters running HTCondor (http://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/). It is designed to display information on the HTCondor job submissions using a web browser (jobs, users, CPU load). The program is written in Java and can be used as an applet. The program was developed to monitor job resources, query job status and users.</p>
