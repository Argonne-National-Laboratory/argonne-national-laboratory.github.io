<a href="https://bitbucket.org/diatomic/tess">Tess</a></h3>
<p>Computing a Voronoi or Delaunay tessellation from a set of points is a core part of the analysis of many simulated and measured datasets. As the scale of simulations and observations surpasses billions of particles, a distributed-memory scalable parallel algorithm is the only feasible approach. The primary contribution of this software is a distributed-memory parallel Delaunay and Voronoi tessellation algorithm based on existing serial computational geometry libraries that automatically determines which neighbor points need to be exchanged among the subdomains of a spatial decomposition. Other features include periodic and wall boundary conditions.</p>

<p>Argonne's Advanced Photon Source is a synchrotron light source that produces high-energy, high-brightness x-ray beams. The source is optimized to put large quantities of high-energy photons into a very small area in a very short time.The XRAY subversion server supports the Xray beamlines at the Advanced Photon Source. </p>

<p>TomoPy is a Python toolbox to perform tomographic data processing and image reconstruction tasks at the Advanced Photon Source (http://www.aps.anl.gov).</p>
